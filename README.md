## About Me
I'm a computer engineer who is passionate about coding and making tweaks. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Java, C++, C, and Assembly. Experienced in Selenium WebDriver automation. I was recently selected to work in manual testing, incorporating Azure DevOps. I enjoy developing custom modifications for games in my spare time. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges.
